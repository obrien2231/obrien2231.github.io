    <h1>Usability</h1>
    <div>
      <h4>Layout of Website</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>I have my homepage as the main direction to all my pages, I decided to have multiple different pages becasue I believed it is easier to navigate than scrolling.</li>
        <li>Moving foward I would like to improve the layout of my website by making transitions from page to page easier, keeping the buttons up on every page that is visited. To eliminate the need to continusly return to the home page.</li>
        <li>Also on the homepage I would like to edit where the audio control is on the page.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Color Scheme</h4>
      <ul>
          <li>On my homepage I decided to pair my background picture with a grey and blue color scheme to prevent any contrast errrors.</li>
          <li>On all other pages I decided to stick to white background with black font as a simple design, which I will edit to be more in depth in the future.</li>
          <li>Looking forward I hope to create a custom background that will be used on all pages beside the homepage.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Images</h4>
      <ul>
          <li>On my homepage I went with an FGCU image to show why I made the website as well as to create a link back to the school's website.</li>
          <li>I also used a video on my about page because it helps give a more indepth look in to what really matters to me such as my dog.</li>
          <li>In the future I hope to add more images of myself and my hobbies, I also hope to add images of some of the work I have done to provide a preview for the links on my page</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Future of Website</h4>
      <ul>
          <li>In the near future of this website I hope to complete all the goals I listed above, as well as to clean and add notes to my code</li>
          <li>In the next coule months as my coding skills continue to grow I will coninually update the site, and hopefully provide a more streamlined experience.</li>
      </ul>
